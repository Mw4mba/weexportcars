# Vercel Deployment Fix - WhoWeAre Module Error

## Issue
**Error**: `Module not found: Can't resolve './components/WhoWeAre'`

**Cause**: The `src/app/wec2/` directory was not completely removed. A `page.tsx` file remained that was trying to import `./components/WhoWeAre`, which no longer existed because the components were moved to `src/components/wec/`.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

During the archive cleanup process:
1. We successfully moved `src/app/wec2/` → `src/app/_archive/wec2/`
2. However, a `page.tsx` file was recreated or remained in `src/app/wec2/`
3. This orphaned file still had the import: `import WhoWeAre from './components/WhoWeAre'`
4. The `./components/WhoWeAre` path no longer existed (moved to `src/components/wec/WhoWeAre`)
5. Vercel build failed trying to resolve this import

---

## Solution Applied

### Step 1: Identified the Problem
```bash
# Found the orphaned file
src/app/wec2/page.tsx  # Still trying to import './components/WhoWeAre'
```

### Step 2: Removed Orphaned Directory
```powershell
Remove-Item -Path "d:\apps2\we-export-cars\src\app\wec2" -Recurse -Force
```

### Step 3: Verified Removal
```
src/app/
├── about/
├── api/
├── car/
├── services/
├── showroom/
├── _archive/          ← Contains archived wec2
│   └── wec2/
│       ├── page.tsx.archived
│       └── components/
│           └── WhoWeAre.tsx.archived
└── [no wec2 here]     ← ✅ Removed
```

### Step 4: Verified Build
```bash
npm run build
# ✓ Compiled successfully in 4.8s
# ✓ Generating static pages (14/14)
# ✅ NO ERRORS
```

## Verification Checklist

- [x] ✅ `src/app/wec2/` directory completely removed
- [x] ✅ No orphaned page.tsx files
- [x] ✅ WhoWeAre component in correct location: `src/components/wec/WhoWeAre.tsx`
- [x] ✅ Main page imports correctly: `import WhoWeAre from '@/components/wec/WhoWeAre'`
- [x] ✅ Build completes successfully
- [x] ✅ All 14 pages generated
- [x] ✅ No module resolution errors

## Current State

### Active WhoWeAre Component
**Location**: `src/components/wec/WhoWeAre.tsx`
```typescript
import React from "react";
import AnimatedTitle from './AnimatedTitle';
import { COLORS } from './constants';

const WhoWeAre: React.FC<WhoWeAreProps> = ({ className = "" }) => (
  <div className={className}>
    <AnimatedTitle id="who-we-are">Who We Are.</AnimatedTitle>
    <p className="text-lg md:text-xl max-w-3xl leading-relaxed" 
       style={{ color: COLORS.dark }}>
      We Export Cars Africa (WEC Africa) is South Africa's leading platform...
    </p>
  </div>
);

export default WhoWeAre;
```

### Import in Main Page
**Location**: `src/app/page.tsx`
```typescript
import WhoWeAre from '@/components/wec/WhoWeAre'; // ✅ Correct path
```

### Archived Version
**Location**: `src/app/_archive/wec2/components/WhoWeAre.tsx.archived`
- Renamed to `.archived` extension
- Not compiled by Next.js
- Kept for reference only

### For Vercel
1. **Commit Changes**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Remove orphaned wec2 directory causing module resolution error"
```

2. **Push to Repository**:
```bash
git push origin main
```

3. **Vercel Auto-Deploy**:

### Verification After Deploy
- [ ] Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Verify build completes without errors
- [ ] Test production URL
- [ ] Confirm WhoWeAre section displays correctly

## Prevention

### Why This Happened
The initial archive process may have encountered a file lock or permission issue, leaving behind the `page.tsx` file while moving other files.

### How to Prevent
1. Always verify directory removal with `ls` or `Get-ChildItem`
2. Use `git status` to check for uncommitted files
3. Run local build before pushing to catch issues early
4. Use `.gitignore` to prevent committing experimental directories
