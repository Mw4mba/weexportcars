## Process
**HOW IT WORKS**
**Step 1 - Selecting Your Vehicle**

Please choose your preferred vehicle from one of the following websites and forward the link to us via WhatsApp or email.

<www.cars.co.za> or <www.autotrader.co.za>

**Step 2 - Due Diligence**

We will conduct thorough due diligence on both the vehicle and the seller. The vehicle's VIN number will be processed through First Check to verify that it has not been involved in any accidents or reported as stolen. Upon receiving confirmation, we will proceed to issue an invoice to you.

**Step 3 - Invoicing**

You will receive a detailed invoice outlining all relevant charges, including vehicle inspection (if required by the destination country), police clearance, export permit, customs documentation, freight, and logistics services.

**Step 4 - Payment & Vehicle Collection**

Upon confirmation of funds received, payment is remitted to the dealership, and arrangements are made to collect the vehicle.

**Step 5- Police Clearance**

The vehicle will be presented to the South African Police Service for police clearance. During this process, the vehicle is designated for export, and a police clearance certificate is issued to confirm that it has not been reported as stolen.

**Step 6- Road worthy inspection**

In certain countries, it is a regulatory requirement that all imported vehicles are certified as roadworthy. This process is handled by Dekra, we take the vehicle here for the roadworthy inspection.

**Step 7- Export Permit**

An Export Permit is mandated by the South African government for all goods exported from South Africa. We handle the application for your vehicle's export permit on your behalf through the International Trade Administration Commission of South Africa.

**Step 8- Customs Documents**

These documents constitute the final requirements necessary for the export of your vehicle from South Africa. They must be presented to the designated shipping line, airline, or border authorities to facilitate the departure of the vehicle from the Republic of South Africa.

**Step 9 - Delivery**

We provide multiple delivery options, including air, road, and sea transport. Our team will offer expert recommendations tailored to your country of destination to ensure the most efficient method is selected.

**Step 10: Receiving your vehicle**

The vehicle will be handled by your designated clearing agent, who will inspect and receive the vehicle on your behalf.
