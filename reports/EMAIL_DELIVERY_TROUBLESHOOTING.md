# Email Delivery Troubleshooting Report
**Project:** We Export Cars Contact Form  
**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Issue:** Multiple recipients not receiving emails

---

## üî¥ Current Problem

**Recipients configured:**
```typescript
to: [
  'mwambaandy06@gmail.com',      // ‚úÖ Receiving emails
  'kamatu@weexportcars.africa',  // ‚ùå NOT receiving emails
  '4ndilok@gmail.com'             // ‚ùå NOT receiving emails
]
```

**Symptoms:**
- Only `mwambaandy06@gmail.com` receives contact form submissions
- Other two recipients never receive any emails
- No error messages in the API response
- Resend API returns success status

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Using `onboarding@resend.dev` Domain

**Current sender address:**
```typescript
from: 'We Export Cars <onboarding@resend.dev>'
```

**The Problem:**
- `onboarding@resend.dev` is Resend's **testing sandbox domain**
- It has **strict delivery restrictions** for security and anti-spam
- Only **verified recipient email addresses** in your Resend account receive emails
- All other recipients are silently blocked to prevent spam abuse

**Why only mwambaandy06@gmail.com works:**
- This email is likely the account owner email used to sign up for Resend
- Resend automatically allows emails to the account owner
- OR it was manually verified as a test recipient in Resend dashboard

---

## üìä Verification Steps

### Step 1: Check Resend Dashboard for Delivery Status

1. **Login to Resend:** https://resend.com/login
2. **Go to:** Dashboard ‚Üí Emails (or https://resend.com/emails)
3. **Find recent email sends** from contact form
4. **Check status for each recipient:**

   **Expected findings:**
   ```
   To: mwambaandy06@gmail.com
   Status: ‚úÖ Delivered
   
   To: kamatu@weexportcars.africa
   Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Not sent (sandbox restriction)
   
   To: 4ndilok@gmail.com
   Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Not sent (sandbox restriction)
   ```

### Step 2: Check for Bounce/Error Messages

1. **In Resend Dashboard**, click on individual email
2. **Look for warnings/errors** like:
   - "Sandbox mode: Only verified recipients"
   - "Domain not verified"
   - "Recipient blocked in sandbox"

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Options (In Order of Recommendation)

### **Solution 1: Add Recipients as Test Contacts (Quick Fix - 5 minutes)**

**Best for:** Immediate testing, temporary solution

**How to implement:**

1. **Login to Resend:** https://resend.com
2. **Go to:** Settings ‚Üí Testing (or Domains ‚Üí onboarding@resend.dev)
3. **Find:** "Test Recipients" or "Allowed Recipients" section
4. **Add both email addresses:**
   - `kamatu@weexportcars.africa`
   - `4ndilok@gmail.com`
5. **Save changes**
6. **Test:** Submit a new contact form

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Free (no cost)
- ‚úÖ Works immediately (no waiting)
- ‚úÖ No code changes needed
- ‚úÖ No domain setup required

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Limited to ~5-10 test recipients only
- ‚ùå Still shows sender as `onboarding@resend.dev` (not professional)
- ‚ùå Not suitable for production
- ‚ùå Recipients might mark as spam

**Status:** ‚ö° **Recommended for immediate fix**

---

### **Solution 2: Set Up Custom Domain (Professional - 30 minutes)**

**Best for:** Production use, professional appearance, unlimited recipients

**Required domain:** `weexportcars.africa` (you own this domain)

#### Step 2.1: Verify Domain in Resend

1. **Login to Resend:** https://resend.com
2. **Go to:** Domains ‚Üí Add Domain
3. **Enter:** `weexportcars.africa`
4. **Resend will provide DNS records** like:

   ```
   Type: TXT
   Name: _resend
   Value: resend-verify=abc123def456...
   
   Type: MX
   Name: @
   Priority: 10
   Value: mx.resend.com
   
   Type: TXT
   Name: @
   Value: v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all
   
   Type: TXT
   Name: resend._domainkey
   Value: p=MIGfMA0GCS... [long DKIM key]
   ```

#### Step 2.2: Add DNS Records to Domain Provider

**Where is your domain registered?** (Common providers)
- GoDaddy
- Namecheap
- Cloudflare
- Google Domains
- Hostinger
- etc.

**DNS Setup Steps:**

1. **Login to your domain provider**
2. **Find:** DNS Management / DNS Records / Advanced DNS
3. **Add all 4 records** provided by Resend:
   - TXT record for verification
   - MX record for receiving
   - SPF (TXT) record for sending
   - DKIM (TXT) record for authentication
4. **Save changes**
5. **Wait:** 15 minutes - 24 hours for DNS propagation (usually ~30 minutes)

#### Step 2.3: Verify in Resend

1. **Go back to Resend:** Domains page
2. **Click:** "Verify Domain" next to `weexportcars.africa`
3. **Wait for green checkmark:** "Domain verified ‚úÖ"

#### Step 2.4: Update Code to Use Custom Domain

**File:** `src/app/api/contact/route.ts`

**Change from:**
```typescript
from: 'We Export Cars <onboarding@resend.dev>'
```

**Change to:**
```typescript
from: 'We Export Cars <contact@weexportcars.africa>'
```

**Or use any email prefix:**
- `noreply@weexportcars.africa`
- `info@weexportcars.africa`
- `inquiries@weexportcars.africa`
- `notifications@weexportcars.africa`

**Full updated code:**
```typescript
// Send email via Resend
const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
  from: 'We Export Cars <contact@weexportcars.africa>', // ‚úÖ YOUR DOMAIN
  to: [
    'mwambaandy06@gmail.com',
    'kamatu@weexportcars.africa',
    '4ndilok@gmail.com'
  ],
  replyTo: sanitizedEmail,
  subject: `New Export Inquiry - ${vehicleName}`,
  react: ContactFormEmail({
    name: sanitizedName,
    email: sanitizedEmail,
    vehicle: vehicleName,
    country: sanitizedCountry,
    message: sanitizedMessage,
  }),
});
```

#### Step 2.5: Rebuild and Deploy

```bash
# Rebuild the project
npm run build

# Deploy to production
git add .
git commit -m "Update email sender to use custom domain"
git push origin main
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Professional sender address
- ‚úÖ Unlimited recipients
- ‚úÖ Better deliverability (fewer spam flags)
- ‚úÖ Production-ready
- ‚úÖ Can send to ANY email address
- ‚úÖ Build trust with customers

**Cons:**
- ‚è±Ô∏è Takes 30-60 minutes to set up
- üìù Requires DNS management access
- ‚è≥ DNS propagation wait time

**Status:** üèÜ **Recommended for production**

---

### **Solution 3: Use BCC for Hidden Recipients (Alternative - 2 minutes)**

**Best for:** When you want primary recipient visible, others hidden

**Update code:**
```typescript
const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
  from: 'We Export Cars <onboarding@resend.dev>',
  to: ['mwambaandy06@gmail.com'], // Primary recipient
  bcc: [
    'kamatu@weexportcars.africa',
    '4ndilok@gmail.com'
  ],
  replyTo: sanitizedEmail,
  subject: `New Export Inquiry - ${vehicleName}`,
  react: ContactFormEmail({
    name: sanitizedName,
    email: sanitizedEmail,
    vehicle: vehicleName,
    country: sanitizedCountry,
    message: sanitizedMessage,
  }),
});
```

**Note:** This still requires Solution 1 (add test recipients) or Solution 2 (custom domain) to work!

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Recipients don't see each other's emails
- ‚úÖ Cleaner for privacy

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Doesn't solve the sandbox restriction issue
- ‚ùå Still needs Solution 1 or 2

---

### **Solution 4: Send Individual Emails to Each Recipient (Fallback - 5 minutes)**

**Only if Solutions 1-2 fail**

**Update code to send separate emails:**
```typescript
const recipients = [
  'mwambaandy06@gmail.com',
  'kamatu@weexportcars.africa',
  '4ndilok@gmail.com'
];

// Send to each recipient individually
const emailPromises = recipients.map(recipient => 
  resend.emails.send({
    from: 'We Export Cars <onboarding@resend.dev>',
    to: [recipient],
    replyTo: sanitizedEmail,
    subject: `New Export Inquiry - ${vehicleName}`,
    react: ContactFormEmail({
      name: sanitizedName,
      email: sanitizedEmail,
      vehicle: vehicleName,
      country: sanitizedCountry,
      message: sanitizedMessage,
    }),
  })
);

// Wait for all emails to send
const results = await Promise.allSettled(emailPromises);

// Check if at least one succeeded
const successCount = results.filter(r => r.status === 'fulfilled').length;
if (successCount === 0) {
  throw new Error('Failed to send email to any recipient');
}
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Each recipient gets individual email
- ‚úÖ Can track individual failures

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Uses 3x email quota
- ‚ùå Still doesn't fix sandbox restriction
- ‚ùå More complex code
- ‚ùå Slower (sequential API calls)

---

- [ ] Verify "Reply-To" works correctly
- [ ] Check email formatting looks good
- [ ] Test from mobile device
- [ ] Verify rate limiting still works

---

## üìã Additional Checks

### Check 1: Email Provider Spam Filters

**For kamatu@weexportcars.africa:**
- Check spam/junk folder
- Check email provider settings (if using custom email host)
- Whitelist `@resend.dev` domain (temporary)
- Whitelist `@weexportcars.africa` domain (after custom setup)

**For 4ndilok@gmail.com:**
- Check Gmail spam folder
- Check Gmail "Social" or "Promotions" tabs
- Create filter to move emails to Primary inbox

### Check 2: Resend Account Limits

**Verify your Resend plan:**
1. Go to: https://resend.com/settings/billing
2. Check current plan: Free / Pro / Business
3. Verify quota usage: X / 100 daily emails

**Free tier limits:**
- 100 emails/day
- 3,000 emails/month
- Multiple recipients count as 1 email (good!)

### Check 3: API Response Logging

**Add detailed logging to diagnose issues:**

```typescript
// After sending email
if (error) {
  console.error('Resend API error:', {
    error: error,
    code: error.statusCode,
    message: error.message,
    recipients: ['mwambaandy06@gmail.com', 'kamatu@weexportcars.africa', '4ndilok@gmail.com']
  });
} else {
  console.log('Email sent successfully:', {
    messageId: data?.id,
    from: 'We Export Cars <onboarding@resend.dev>',
    to: ['mwambaandy06@gmail.com', 'kamatu@weexportcars.africa', '4ndilok@gmail.com'],
    status: 'sent'
  });
}
```

**Check logs:**
```bash
# In development
npm run dev
# Submit form and watch terminal output

# In production (Vercel)
# Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
# Select project ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Latest ‚Üí View Function Logs
```

## üÜò If Nothing Works

### Contact Resend Support

**Email:** support@resend.com  
**Discord:** https://resend.com/discord  

**Include in support request:**
1. Your Resend account email
2. Message ID from successful send (get from Resend dashboard)
3. List of recipients not receiving emails
4. Screenshot of DNS records (if using custom domain)
5. Error messages from logs (if any)

---

## üìä Expected Timeline

| Solution | Setup Time | Works For | Production Ready |
|----------|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| Solution 1: Test Recipients | 5 minutes | Testing only | ‚ùå No |
| Solution 2: Custom Domain | 30-60 minutes | Production | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Solution 3: BCC | 2 minutes | With 1 or 2 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Depends |
| Solution 4: Individual Emails | 5 minutes | With 1 or 2 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Workaround |

---

## üí° Key Takeaway

**The issue is NOT with your code - it's with Resend's sandbox domain restrictions.**

Your code is correctly configured to send to all three recipients. The problem is that `onboarding@resend.dev` is a test domain that only delivers to verified/whitelisted addresses.

**Choose your path:**
- **Need it working TODAY?** ‚Üí Do Solution 1 (5 minutes)
- **Want it professional?** ‚Üí Do Solution 2 (30 minutes)
- **Want both?** ‚Üí Do Solution 1 now, Solution 2 this week ‚úÖ

---

## üìû Next Steps

1. **Decision:** Choose Solution 1 or Solution 2 (or both)
2. **Action:** Follow the steps in chosen solution
3. **Test:** Submit contact form and verify all recipients
4. **Monitor:** Check Resend dashboard for delivery status
5. **Optimize:** Set up custom domain for long-term use
