# Build Error Fix - WhoWeAreAndOfferings Component

## Issue
**Error Type:** TypeScript compilation error  
**Date:** December 18, 2024  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

## Error Details

```
Type error: Property 'isWide' does not exist on type '{ readonly title: "SUVs"; readonly image: "/we-export_1.png"; readonly link: "#suvs"; } | { readonly title: "Classic / Retro Cars"; readonly image: "/we-export_2.jpg"; readonly link: "#classic-cars"; } | { ...; }'.
Property 'isWide' does not exist on type '{ readonly title: "SUVs"; readonly image: "/we-export_1.png"; readonly link: "#suvs"; }'.

Location: src/components/home/WhoWeAreAndOfferings.tsx:64:30
```

---

## Root Cause

The `OFFERINGS` array was defined using `as const`, which made TypeScript infer the exact types for each object. Since only one offering had the `isWide` property, TypeScript couldn't guarantee that all offerings would have this property, causing a type error when trying to access `offering.isWide`.

**Before (Problematic Code):**
```tsx
const OFFERINGS = [
  {
    title: "SUVs",
    image: "/we-export_1.png",
    link: "#suvs"
  },
  {
    title: "Classic / Retro Cars",
    image: "/we-export_2.jpg",
    link: "#classic-cars"
  },
  {
    title: "Export Services",
    image: "/we-export_3.jpg",
    link: "#export",
    isWide: true  // Only this one has isWide
  }
] as const;  // This creates a union type without optional properties
```

---

## Solution

Define an explicit TypeScript type with `isWide` as an **optional property**, then type the array accordingly.

**After (Fixed Code):**
```tsx
type Offering = {
  title: string;
  image: string;
  link: string;
  isWide?: boolean;  // Optional property
};

const OFFERINGS: Offering[] = [
  {
    title: "SUVs",
    image: "/we-export_1.png",
    link: "#suvs"
  },
  {
    title: "Classic / Retro Cars",
    image: "/we-export_2.jpg",
    link: "#classic-cars"
  },
  {
    title: "Export Services",
    image: "/we-export_3.jpg",
    link: "#export",
    isWide: true
  }
];
```

## Changes Made

### File: `src/components/home/WhoWeAreAndOfferings.tsx`

**Lines 9-28:**

1. **Added Type Definition:**
   ```tsx
   type Offering = {
     title: string;
     image: string;
     link: string;
     isWide?: boolean;  // Optional property
   };
   ```

2. **Updated Array Type:**
   ```tsx
   // Before
   const OFFERINGS = [...] as const;
   
   // After
   const OFFERINGS: Offering[] = [...];
   ```

3. **Removed `as const` assertion** - Not needed with explicit typing

---

## Why This Works

1. **Optional Property:** The `?` in `isWide?: boolean` tells TypeScript this property might not exist on all objects
2. **Explicit Typing:** `Offering[]` gives every item in the array the same type structure
3. **Type Safety:** TypeScript now knows to check for `isWide` existence before using it
4. **Runtime Safety:** The conditional `offering.isWide ? ... : ...` safely handles both cases

---

## Build Verification

**Build Command:** `npm run build`

**Result:** ✅ Success
```
✓ Compiled successfully in 7.5s
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages (15/15)
✓ Collecting build traces
✓ Finalizing page optimization
```

**Bundle Sizes:**
- Home page: 172 kB (First Load JS)
- Build time: 7.5s
- All routes compiled successfully

---

## Impact Assessment

### Functionality
- ✅ No change in runtime behavior
- ✅ Grid layout still works (SUVs and Classic side-by-side, Export full-width)
- ✅ Hover effects maintained
- ✅ Image loading unchanged

### Type Safety
- ✅ TypeScript now properly understands the data structure
- ✅ Better IDE autocomplete for `OFFERINGS` array
- ✅ Catches potential errors if new offerings are added without proper structure

### Performance
- ✅ No runtime overhead (types are compile-time only)
- ✅ Bundle size unchanged
- ✅ Build time similar (~7.5s)

---

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Build compiles without errors ✅
- [x] TypeScript type checking passes ✅
- [x] No ESLint errors ✅
- [x] Component renders correctly ✅
- [x] Grid layout works (2 items side-by-side, 1 full-width) ✅
- [x] `isWide` property properly applies `col-span-2` class ✅

## Related Files

This fix only affected one file:
- `src/components/home/WhoWeAreAndOfferings.tsx`

No other files needed changes.

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Explicit Type Definitions:** Always define types for data structures, especially when properties are optional
2. **Optional Properties:** Use `?` for properties that may not exist on all objects
3. **Avoid `as const` for Mutable Data:** Only use `as const` for truly immutable configurations
4. **Type Annotations:** Prefer explicit type annotations over type inference for public APIs

## Future Considerations

### If Adding More Offerings:

```tsx
const OFFERINGS: Offering[] = [
  // ... existing offerings
  {
    title: "New Offering",
    image: "/new-image.jpg",
    link: "#new",
    isWide: false  // Optional: can specify or omit
  }
];
```

### If Adding More Optional Properties:

```tsx
type Offering = {
  title: string;
  image: string;
  link: string;
  isWide?: boolean;
  isHighlighted?: boolean;  // Example: new optional property
  badge?: string;            // Example: optional badge text
};
```

---

## Conclusion

**Issue:** TypeScript type error due to inconsistent property structure in array  
**Root Cause:** Missing type definition with optional properties  
**Solution:** Added explicit `Offering` type with `isWide?` as optional property  
**Result:** ✅ Build successful, no type errors, functionality preserved  

**Build Status:** ✅ **PASSING** - All checks passed, production build ready.
