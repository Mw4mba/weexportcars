# Showroom Image Configuration Fix
**Fixed: October 16, 2025**

---

## üêõ Issue

**Error:**
```
Invalid src prop (https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1563720360172-67b8f3dce741?w=800&q=80) 
on `next/image`, hostname "images.unsplash.com" is not configured under 
images in your `next.config.js`
```

**Location:** Showroom page (`/showroom`)

**Root Cause:** Vehicle data in `/src/lib/vehicleData.ts` uses Unsplash images, but `images.unsplash.com` wasn't configured as an allowed remote image hostname in Next.js config.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution

### Updated `next.config.ts`:

```typescript
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: 'https',
        hostname: 'images.unsplash.com',
        port: '',
        pathname: '/**',
      },
    ],
  },
};

export default nextConfig;
```

## üìä Result

**Build Status:** ‚úÖ **Successful**

```
Route (app)                               Size  First Load JS
‚îú ‚óã /showroom                          27.1 kB         179 kB
```

- No errors
- All pages build successfully
- Unsplash images now load properly with Next.js Image component optimization

---

## üîß Technical Details

### Why This Was Needed:
Next.js requires explicit configuration for external image domains for security reasons. The `remotePatterns` configuration:
- Allows Next.js to optimize Unsplash images
- Provides automatic image resizing and format conversion (WebP/AVIF)
- Enables lazy loading and blur placeholders
- Maintains security by only allowing specific domains

### Files Affected:
- `/next.config.ts` - Added Unsplash to remote patterns
- `/src/lib/vehicleData.ts` - Uses Unsplash images (no changes needed)
- `/src/components/showroom/VehicleCard.tsx` - Uses Next.js Image component (already optimized)

---

## üöÄ Benefits

1. **Image Optimization:** Automatic format conversion and resizing
2. **Performance:** Lazy loading and progressive image loading
3. **Security:** Controlled external image sources
4. **Quality:** Automatic quality optimization based on device

## üìù Notes

**Unsplash Images Found In:**
- Vehicle data for all showroom vehicles
- Gallery images for each vehicle detail page
- Total: 20+ Unsplash image URLs

**Alternative Consideration:**
For production, consider:
- Moving to your own CDN (faster, more control)
- Using local images (no external dependencies)
- Using a paid image service (better licensing, no rate limits)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Resolved  
**Build:** Successful  
**Showroom Page:** Working perfectly
