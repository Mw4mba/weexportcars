# Navigation and Services Page Removal - October 18, 2025

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Anchor Links
All links use `/#process` format for reliable navigation:
- From Export Services card: `/#process`
- From navigation: `/#process`
- From footer: `#process` (already on homepage)

### Section ID
The process section maintains its `id="process"` attribute:
```tsx
<section id="process" ref={ref} className="...">
```

This ensures:
- Backward compatibility with existing links
- Smooth scroll behavior works correctly
- Bookmarks still function

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

**Option 2: Add Redirect**
```tsx
// In next.config.ts
async redirects() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/services',
      destination: '/#process',
      permanent: true, // 301 redirect
    },
  ]
}
```

**Option 3: Delete Page**
- Remove `/src/app/services/` directory
