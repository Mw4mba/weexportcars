# Contact Form Updates Summary

## Changes Implemented
**Date:** December 18, 2024  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## 1. ✅ Country Search Functionality Fixed

### Problem
The country combobox search wasn't working correctly - users couldn't search for countries by name (e.g., "Kenya").

### Root Cause
The `CommandItem` component was using the `value` prop (country code like "ke") for search matching instead of the `label` (country name like "Kenya").

### Solution
**File:** `src/components/ui/combobox.tsx`

Updated the CommandItem to:
- Use `label` as the searchable value
- Added `keywords` prop for better search matching
- Updated `onSelect` handler to find the option by label and return its value

**Before:**
```tsx
<CommandItem
  key={option.value}
  value={option.value}  // ❌ Searches by country code "ke"
  onSelect={(currentValue) => {
    onValueChange?.(currentValue === value ? "" : currentValue)
    setOpen(false)
  }}
>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<CommandItem
  key={option.value}
  value={option.label}  // ✅ Searches by country name "Kenya"
  keywords={[option.label, option.value]}
  onSelect={(currentValue) => {
    const selectedOption = options.find(
      (opt) => opt.label.toLowerCase() === currentValue.toLowerCase()
    )
    onValueChange?.(selectedOption?.value === value ? "" : selectedOption?.value || "")
    setOpen(false)
  }}
>
```

### Result
✅ Users can now search for countries by name (e.g., "Kenya", "United States", "South Africa")  
✅ Search is case-insensitive  
✅ Both country name and code are searchable

---

## 2. ✅ WhatsApp Button Unified

### Problem
The WhatsApp button at the bottom of the contact form used a placeholder number (`1234567890`) instead of the actual business number.

### Solution
**File:** `src/components/home/ContactFormSection.tsx`

Updated to match the FloatingWhatsApp component configuration.

**Before:**
```tsx
href="https://wa.me/1234567890"
```

**After:**
```tsx
href="https://wa.me/27100859932?text=Hello%20we%20export%20cars"
```

### Result
✅ Both WhatsApp buttons now direct to the same number: `+27 100 859 932`  
✅ Pre-filled message: "Hello we export cars"  
✅ Consistent user experience across the site

---

## 3. ✅ Email Recipients Updated

### Problem
Contact form submissions only went to one email address.

### Solution
**File:** `src/app/api/contact/route.ts`

Added `kamatu@weexportcars.africa` to the recipients list using Option 1 (Multiple Recipients).

**Before:**
```typescript
to: ['mwambaandy06@gmail.com'],
```

**After:**
```typescript
to: [
  'mwambaandy06@gmail.com',
  'kamatu@weexportcars.africa'
],
```

### Result
✅ Contact form submissions now sent to both email addresses  
✅ Both recipients receive the same email  
✅ Both can reply directly to the customer (replyTo is set to customer's email)

---

## 4. 📄 Resend Audience Limits Documentation

### Created Comprehensive Guide
**File:** `RESEND_AUDIENCE_LIMITS_GUIDE.md`

**Contents:**
- Detailed explanation of Resend pricing tiers
- Clarification that "audience limits" don't apply to contact forms (transactional email)
- Four options for scaling recipient lists
- Comparison of alternative email services (SendGrid, Postmark, Amazon SES, Mailgun)
- Cost analysis and recommendations
- Migration guides for switching providers

**Key Insights:**
- Current Resend free tier (100 emails/day) is more than sufficient
- "Audience" feature is for marketing, not transactional emails
- Contact forms use transactional email - no audience management needed
- Recommended staying with Resend unless volume exceeds 100/day

## Technical Details

### Email Configuration

**Current Setup:**
```typescript
const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
  from: 'We Export Cars <onboarding@resend.dev>',
  to: [
    'mwambaandy06@gmail.com',
    'kamatu@weexportcars.africa'
  ],
  replyTo: sanitizedEmail,
  subject: `New Export Inquiry - ${vehicleName}`,
  react: ContactFormEmail({ /* ... */ }),
});
```

**Limitations:**
- Maximum ~50 recipients per email (Resend API limit)
- All recipients receive identical email
- All recipients visible to each other

**Recommendations for Future:**
- If more recipients needed, consider BCC approach (Option 2)
- If >10 recipients, use environment variables (Option 3)
- If >50 recipients, implement database-driven solution (Option 4)

### WhatsApp Integration

**Number Format:** `+27 100 859 932`  
**URL Format:** `https://wa.me/27100859932?text=Hello%20we%20export%20cars`

**Notes:**
- WhatsApp removes spaces/special characters from phone number
- Message is URL encoded
- `wa.me` is WhatsApp's universal link format

---

## Performance Impact

### Bundle Size
- No increase in bundle size
- Email configuration changes are server-side only
- Combobox fix is minimal JavaScript change

### Build Time
- ✅ Compiled successfully in 50s
- No significant impact on build time

### Runtime Performance
- Country search: No measurable impact (same component, better logic)
- Email sending: No change (same API call, just more recipients)
- WhatsApp: No change (static link)

---

## Security Considerations

### Email Recipients
- ✅ Email addresses not exposed to client
- ✅ Server-side only configuration
- ✅ ReplyTo validation in place
- ✅ Sanitization of user inputs

### WhatsApp Link
- ✅ Phone number is public (visible on site)
- ✅ No sensitive data in pre-filled message
- ✅ Opens in new tab with proper security attributes

---

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Email Routing by Vehicle Type:**
   ```typescript
   const getRecipients = (vehicleType: string) => {
     if (vehicleType.includes('SUV')) return ['suv-sales@weexportcars.africa'];
     if (vehicleType.includes('Classic')) return ['classic-sales@weexportcars.africa'];
     return ['mwambaandy06@gmail.com', 'kamatu@weexportcars.africa'];
   };
   ```

2. **Email Routing by Country:**
   ```typescript
   const getRecipients = (country: string) => {
     const africanCountries = ['kenya', 'uganda', 'tanzania', ...];
     if (africanCountries.includes(country.toLowerCase())) {
       return ['africa-sales@weexportcars.africa'];
     }
     return ['international-sales@weexportcars.africa'];
   };
   ```

3. **Dynamic WhatsApp Message:**
   ```typescript
   const vehicle = selectedVehicle || 'a vehicle';
   const message = `Hi, I'm interested in ${vehicle}`;
   const whatsappLink = `https://wa.me/27100859932?text=${encodeURIComponent(message)}`;
   ```

4. **Email Notifications to Customer:**
   ```typescript
   // Send confirmation email to customer
   await resend.emails.send({
     from: 'We Export Cars <noreply@weexportcars.com>',
     to: [sanitizedEmail],
     subject: 'We received your inquiry!',
     react: ConfirmationEmail({ name: sanitizedName }),
   });
   ```
