# ✅ Archive Cleanup Complete - Final Status

## Summary
Successfully archived experimental `wec` and `wec2` directories, extracted necessary components, updated all imports, and verified the application builds and runs correctly.

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Archive Structure ✓
- Created `src/app/_archive/` directory (underscore prefix excludes from Next.js routing)
- Moved `wec` and `wec2` directories to archive
- Created comprehensive README.md in archive explaining contents and purpose

### 2. Component Extraction ✓
- **WhoWeAre.tsx**: Extracted from `wec2/components/` → `src/components/wec/`
- Updated imports to use local constants and components
- Properly integrated with existing WEC component library

### 3. Import Updates ✓
- **src/app/page.tsx**: Changed `./wec2/components/WhoWeAre` → `@/components/wec/WhoWeAre`
- **ResponsiveProcessSection.tsx**: Changed `@/app/wec2/components/ProcessSection` → `@/components/wec/ProcessSection`
- All imports now reference active component directory

### 4. Archive Safety ✓
- Renamed all `.tsx` files to `.tsx.archived` to prevent compilation
- Added `src/app/_archive/` to `.gitignore`
- Archive preserved locally but excluded from version control

### 5. Build Verification ✓
```
✓ Compiled successfully in 10.1s
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages (14/14)
✓ Finalizing page optimization
```

### 6. Development Server ✓
```
✓ Started successfully on port 3002
✓ No compilation errors
✓ All routes functional
```

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

### Routing
- ✅ No duplicate experimental routes (`/wec`, `/wec2` no longer accessible)
- ✅ Cleaner site structure for users
- ✅ Reduced confusion about available routes

### Performance
- ✅ Fewer files for Next.js to process
- ✅ Archived files excluded from compilation
- ✅ Build time remains fast (10.1s)

### Code Organization
- ✅ Single source of truth for WEC components
- ✅ All imports use consistent path: `@/components/wec/`
- ✅ Clear separation: active code vs. archived reference

### Maintenance
- ✅ Archive available for reference but not in git
- ✅ No risk of accidentally using outdated components
- ✅ Easy to delete archive when no longer needed
